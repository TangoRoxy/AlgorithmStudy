1. find 2nd largest integer in an unsorted array with n + log2 n -2 comparison:
	divide and conquer: winner has a field that keeps track of its losers after each comparison. 2nd largest will only lose to largest.
	Find the largest by divide and conquer and find the max amongst its loser

2. find the peak of a unimodal array:
	Take 3 points at 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 : divide array into 4 equal parts.
		Increasing: recurse last part;
		decreasing: recurse 1st part;
		else : check midpoint + 1th: increasing -> recurse between 1/2 and 3/4, else 1/4 - 1/2
	O(log n)

3. binary search
